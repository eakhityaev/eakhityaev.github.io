The study used the methods of multivariate statistical analysis using the software package SPSS for statistical data processing. As a result, it was possible to identify the most signiőcant factors affecting the cost of a used car, to establish the nature and strength of the relationship between the dependent variable and the parameters under study, and also, using the example of speciőc car models, to construct regression equations that can be used to estimate the value of a vehicle before buying or selling it on the secondary market.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical analysis of automotive market in Russia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.Khityaev","G.Grechkin","I.Vuraki","A.Safargalieva"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639745195,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639745195,"objectID":"96505e51a807899cb057ea5f50dbb7d2","permalink":"https://eakhityaev.github.io/project/igroup_project/","publishdate":"2021-12-17T15:46:35+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/igroup_project/","section":"project","summary":"Our solution for Project 6 (SciProg)","tags":[],"title":"Group project","type":"project"},{"authors":["E.Khityaev"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639744496,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639744496,"objectID":"8adc1607aeed94f53ebd7fab43dddaec","permalink":"https://eakhityaev.github.io/project/individual_project/","publishdate":"2021-12-17T15:34:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/individual_project/","section":"project","summary":"My personal website","tags":[],"title":"Individual project","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1639741450,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639741450,"objectID":"ea70248dc9a14b32c4e6d6c8e2b561be","permalink":"https://eakhityaev.github.io/post/rudn_news/","publishdate":"2021-12-17T14:44:10+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/rudn_news/","section":"post","summary":"Based on the results of the competitive selection of candidates, which took place from November 19 to December 15, 2021, 25 winners were determined, who will receive a one-time payment of 55,000 rubles per person .","tags":[],"title":"RUDN news: Students will receive payments","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
